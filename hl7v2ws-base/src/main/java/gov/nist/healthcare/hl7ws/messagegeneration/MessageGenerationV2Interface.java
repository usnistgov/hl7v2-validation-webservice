/**
 * NIST HL7 V2 Message Generation Web Service
 * <p>
 * This service provides an interface for generation of HL7 version 2 (V2)
 * message instances for given a message profile or message template. A message
 * template is a sample message. The message can be populated with specific data
 * values via a generation context. The interface is designed for use in a
 * web-service environment.
 * <p>
 * This service supports generation of messages for HL7 Version 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5,
 * and 2.5.1. The version that is used for message generation is dictated by the
 * message profile or by the message template.
 * <p>
 * Messages can be generated using either a profile or a message template.
 * Messages generated from a profile use the XML profile as the guide to build
 * the message structure. Elements are populated from a repository of data
 * values. A generation context can be used to set data values at specific
 * locations. Messages generated with a message template (i.e., a sample
 * massage) combines the template message with a generation context to form a
 * message. The interface also allows to indicate the profile to use.
 * <p>
 * The generate(), generateWithTemplate() are used in combination to generate a
 * message. The loadResource() can be used with the generate() or
 * generateFromTemplate() method if desired profile is not available on the
 * server.

	/**
	 * Generate a message based off an HL7 conformance profile.
	 * <p>
	 * Message generation can create an HL7 v2 message encoded in ER7 or XML.
	 * The message is generated based of an HL7 V2 conformance profile. Messages
	 * generated from a profile use the XML profile as the guide to build the
	 * message structure. Elements are populated from a repository of random
	 * data values; therefore the generated messages by default are not
	 * semantically coherent. A generation context can be used to set data
	 * values at specific locations.
	 * <p>
	 * The generate() method may use an HL7 V2 conformance profile, a
	 * configuration file, and a generation context. The configuration file can
	 * specify HL7 table files that are to be used during the generation
	 * process. By default the generation service uses the HL7 V2 table file in
	 * generation for the corresponding version of the profile. The generation
	 * context specifies data values for specific locations and the encoding
	 * type.
	 * <p>
	 * 
	 * @param OID
	 *            the OID is a reference to the profile used in generation. The
	 *            OID must reference a valid HL7 V2 conformance profile that is
	 *            loaded on the server. The service requires that the profile is
	 *            pre-loaded in the repository and validated.

	 * @param xmlConfig
	 *            is an XML document used to specify generation configuration
	 *            parameters. xmlConfig can contain the following attributes.

	 *            additionalResources: indicates that additional resources are
	 *            used during generation. In HL7 V2 an additional resource can
	 *            be one or more table (i.e., value set) files. An HL7 V2 table
	 *            is identified by the HL7table element. HL7tables are used in
	 *            the order specified by the order element. The HL7table and
	 *            order elements are paired within the HL7resource element. If
	 *            not specified otherwise, the HL7 default table is always used
	 *            last in the generation process. To override this default, set
	 *            the order for the HL7DefaultTable to 0 (i.e., the
	 *            HL7DefaultTable will not be used). Below is an example of an
